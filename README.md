# Lane Detection and Turn Prediction  
This repository contains pipeline to detect lanes on straight and curved roads using classical approach of computer vision to mimic Lane Departure Warning System in self-driving cars. Concepts of homography, polynomial curve fitting, hough lines, warping, and unwarping have been implemented to get the results. The program also predicts turn on curved roads by computing the radius of curvature.

### Instructions to run the file:
Run the following command in the terminal:
```
python straight_lane_detection.py  
python curved_lane_detection.py
```
