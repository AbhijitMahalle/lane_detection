# Lane Detection
  This repository contains pipeline to detect lanes on straight and curved roads using classical approach of computer vision. Concepts of homography, polynomial curve fitting, warping, and unwarping have been implemented to get the results. The program also gives turn prediction on curved roads by computing the radius of curvature. This program can be deployed in self-driving cars to guide the car to stay in lane and to take a turn.
